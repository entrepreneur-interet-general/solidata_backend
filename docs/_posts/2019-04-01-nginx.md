- cf : [tuto linuxize / blocks](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-on-ubuntu-18-04/ )


### SETUP NGINX

-  install nginx

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

-  check status

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

-  check possible configs

```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

-  for http and https 

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' 
```

also 

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS’
```


### MANAGE NGINX SERVICES

```
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

-  if you want to disable the Nginx service to start at boot 

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

* All Nginx configuration files are located in the `/etc/nginx` directory.

* The main Nginx configuration file is `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

* To make Nginx configuration easier to maintain it is recommended to create a separate configuration file for each domain. You can have as many server block files as you need.

* Nginx server block files are stored in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory. The configuration files found in this directory are not used by Nginx unless they are linked to the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory.

* To activate a server block you need to create a symlink (a pointer) from the configuration file sites in a `sites-available` directory to the `sites-enabled` directory.

* It is recommended to follow the standard naming convention, for example if your domain name is mydomain.com then your configuration file should be named `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com.conf`

* The `/etc/nginx/snippets` directory contains configuration snippets that can be included in the server block files. If you use repeatable configuration segments then you can refactor those segments into snippets and include the snippet file to the server blocks.

* Nginx log files (`access.log` and `error.log`) are located in the `/var/log/nginx` directory. It is recommended to have a different access and error log files for each server block.

* You can set your domain document root directory to any location you want. The most common locations for webroot include:
    * `/home/<user_name>/<YOUR-PROD-DOMAIN>`
    * `/var/www/<YOUR-PROD-DOMAIN>`
    * `/var/www/html/<YOUR-PROD-DOMAIN>`
    * `/opt/<YOUR-PROD-DOMAIN>`



### DIRECTORIES FOR BLOCKS OF CODE 

-  make a subdirectory for each subdomain on droplet (-p : make parent dir if needed )  

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/<YOUR-PROD-DOMAIN>/
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/<YOUR-PREPROD-DOMAIN>/
…
```

-  Change group owner of the directory
cf : https://askubuntu.com/questions/488485/allowing-a-group-read-write-access-to-a-directory 

```bash
sudo usermod -aG adminsys www-data
```

-  Change group owner of the directory
cf : https://askubuntu.com/questions/30629/how-can-i-recursively-change-the-permissions-of-files-and-directories 

```bash
sudo chgrp -R adminsys /var/www
```

-  Give write permission to the group / ug == user + group  

```bash
sudo chmod -R ug+rw /var/www
```

------------


### configure nginx for process launched by supervisor

-  create a nginx conf file for this server block

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/<YOUR-PREPROD-DOMAIN>
```

```
server {
        listen 80 ;

        server_name <YOUR-PREPROD-DOMAIN> www.<YOUR-PREPROD-DOMAIN> ;

        location / {

                ### made it work using supervisor + gunicorn
                proxy_pass        http://YOUR.SERVER.IP.ADDRESS:4100/;

                proxy_redirect    off;

                proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP            $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For      $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto    $scheme;

                proxy_pass_header Server;
                proxy_set_header  X-Scheme $scheme;

        }
}

```


-  create link from `sites-available` to `sites-enabled`

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<YOUR-PREPROD-DOMAIN> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

-  check syntax

```
sudo nginx -t
```

-  restart nginx

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
